ei1 = change in evaporative index from 0-1 yr before loss year to 0-1 yr after loss year
-	If loss year is 2005, ei1 = (ei_2004) – (ei_2006)

ei2 = change in evaporative index from 1-2 yrs before loss year to 1-2 yrs after loss year
-	If loss year is 2005, ei2 = (ei_2003 to 2004) – (ei_2006 to 2007)

ei5 = change in evaporative index from 1-5 yrs before loss year to 1-5 yrs after loss year
- If loss year is 2005, ei5 = (ei_2000 to 2004) - (ei_2006 to 2010)
