ei1_1 = change in evaporative index from 0-1 yr before loss year to 0-1 yr after loss year
-	If loss year is 2005, ei1_1 = ei_2004 – ei_2006
ei1_2 = change in evaporative index from 1-2 yrs before loss year to 1-2 yrs after loss year
-	If loss year is 2005, ei1_2 = (ei_2003 to 2004) – (ei_2006 to 2007)
