# Catchment Properties Impact Water Cycling in the Context of Forest Loss: A Global Review

## Predict changes in water cycling from global catchment databases before vs after meaningful forest loss events

This project leverages data from the Hansen et al. 2013 Global Forest Cover Change dataset to identify the year of greatest forest loss in catchments across the world. Long-term water cycling variables (RB-index and evaporative index) 
are calculated from catchment databases (CARAVAN, ROBIN, MacroSheds, ect.). In each catchment, the water cycling time series is broken up into periods before and after the year of greatest forest loss so that change in hydrologic
regulation can be measured before and after the forest loss year. Each catchment contains up to 200+ attributes related to hydrological, geomorphic, anthropogenic, geological, and anthropogenic characteristics. Random forest models 
are used to test the importance of these attributes on the changes in catchment hydrologic regulation (RB and EI indices) after forest loss.
